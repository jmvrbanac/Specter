Specter
========

Specter is a Python testing framework inspired from RSpec and Jasmine. The library was created out of a desire to have a relatively flexible Python testing framework that adopted a more code-centric approach to BDD. 

Specter is open-source and is available on `GitHub`_. We love contributions!
